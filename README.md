I added in the advanced search/filtering and the bulk operations.
The search bar takes the user input and refreshes the list in real time and shows all possible items.
The filtering is a dropdown menu limited to categories so you can quickly see all items under individual categories.
The bulk operations allows for the user to select multiple items in a edit-like mode and proceed to either delete all of those items or update their categories.
